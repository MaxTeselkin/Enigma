# Enigma
Enigma is an encryption machine used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages during the Second World War. According to rough estimates, about 100 thousand copies of Enigma encryption machines were produced in total. During the entire period of active use of Enigma, various government organizations in Europe attempted to hack the machine in order to protect from growing threat from Germany. British intelligence center "Station X", also known as Bletchley Park, succeeded in cryptanalysis of Enigma.
Nowadays copies of Enimga can be found in Computer History Museum in USA.

In this project we will try to recreate this encryption machine step by step using functional programming approach and Python.
